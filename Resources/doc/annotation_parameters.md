PARAMETERS OF AN ANNOTATION
===========================

Parameters of an annotation are key/value pairs but you can define one value without a key. This value would be store in the `value` property of the EasyAnnotation class.

You can find all types supported by the annotation reader [here] (http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/basic-mapping.html#doctrine-mapping-types).
